groktools
groktools is a suite of publicly available tools designed to make developing Python scripts with Grok bulletproof. It provides a set of utilities to maintain scripts with consistent versioning, changelogs, prompt storage, and automated patching, ensuring clarity and traceability even at 3am. Whether youâ€™re managing complex data processing scripts like process_527_stats.py or building visualizations, groktools helps you keep your code organized, documented, and easy to update.
Features

Automated Patching: Generate and apply patches to Python scripts with patchBuilder.py and grokpatcher.py.
Version Tracking: Maintain a VERSION constant to track script versions.
Change Logging: Keep a Change Log section to record updates, artifact IDs, and prompts.
Prompt Storage: Add grok:-annotated comments for documentation and context restoration, with fileref: support for external files.
Context Restoration: Bootstrap conversations by parsing grok: annotations with the Restart tool.
Best Practices: Follow coding standards for consistency and maintainability (see bestpractices.md).

Project Structure

src/: Contains the core tools:
grokpatcher.py: Applies grokpatch files to update scripts.
patchBuilder.py: Generates grokpatch files by comparing before and after files.


docs/: Documentation for each tool (e.g., grokpatcher.md, patchBuilder.md).
docs/prompts/: Prompt files for Grok to use the tools (e.g., groktools_meta_prompt.md).
examples/: Example scripts, patches, and a script to test patching (apply_patches.sh).

Quick Start

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/twinforces/groktools.git
cd groktools


Ensure Requirements:

Python 3.6+ is installed.
No external dependencies are required beyond the standard library.


Explore the Tools:Use Grok to interact with the suite by referencing the meta prompt:

Tell Grok to read docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md to use all features.
Or cherry-pick specific tools using docs/prompts/*_prompt.md files (e.g., grokpatcher_prompt.md).


Try the Examples:The examples/ directory contains sample scripts and patches to demonstrate usage:
cd examples
chmod +x apply_patches.sh
./apply_patches.sh

Follow the instructions in examples/README.md to apply patches using pbcopy and grokpatcher.py.


Tools

GrokPatcher: Applies grokpatch files to update Python scripts using natural and artificial anchors.
PatchBuilder: Generates grokpatch files by comparing before and after versions of a script, automatically incrementing the VERSION.
Versioning: Maintains a VERSION constant to track script versions.
Changelogs: Keeps a Change Log section to record version updates and artifact IDs.
Prompt Storage: Adds grok:-annotated comments for documentation and context restoration.
Restart: Bootstraps conversations by parsing grok: annotations, with optional Change Log enhancement.

Best Practices
All code in groktools adheres to the best practices outlined in docs/prompts/bestpractices.md, including:

DRY principles
Clear naming and docstrings
Declaring constants
Precompiling regexes
Judicious use of classes and MVVM
Automated testing and error handling
Trusting data over specs
Detailed debug logging
PEP 8 formatting with black

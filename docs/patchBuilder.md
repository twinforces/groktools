patchbuilder (Version 1.0)
PatchBuilder is a groktools component that generates grokpatch files for updating Python scripts by comparing before and after versions of a file. It automatically increments the VERSION constant and identifies changes to create patch sections, designed to work seamlessly with grokpatcher.py. Tell Grok to read prompts/patchbuilder_prompt.md to use this feature, or https://github.com/twinforces/groktools/docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md to use all features.
Features

Patch Generation: Creates grokpatch files by comparing before and after files, generating sections for each change (Anchor, AnchorType, Action, Content).
Version Increment: Automatically finds and increments the VERSION constant (e.g., v1.0 to v1.1), logging the change to patchbuilder.log.
UUID for ArtifactID: Automatically generates a unique ArtifactID for each patch using the uuid module.
Error Handling: Validates inputs and logs errors to patchbuilder.log for debugging.
Best Practices Compliance: Follows the coding rules in bestpractices.md, such as DRY, clear naming/docstrings, constants, and PEP 8 formatting.

Requirements

Python 3.6+: Ensure Python is installed to run patchBuilder.py.
grokpatcher.py: The generated grokpatch files are designed to be applied using grokpatcher.py (see grokpatcher.md).

Usage
The patchBuilder.py tool can be used via the command line to generate a grokpatch file by comparing a before and after version of a script. It automatically detects the VERSION constant in the before file, increments it, and generates sections for all changes.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Ensure youâ€™re in the root of the groktools repository:
cd /path/to/groktools


Prepare Before and After Files: Ensure you have the before and after versions of the script (e.g., before.py and after.py). The before file must contain a VERSION constant (e.g., VERSION = "v1.0").

Run patchBuilder.py: Use the following command to generate a grokpatch file:
python src/patchBuilder.py <before_path> <after_path> <output_path>

Example:
python src/patchBuilder.py examples/before.py examples/after.py examples/generated_patch.grokpatch

This generates a grokpatch file (examples/generated_patch.grokpatch) with sections for all changes, including the VERSION increment. For example, if before.py has VERSION = "v1.0" and a function process_data, and after.py modifies process_data, the grokpatch might look like:
# GrokPatcher v1.0
# Target: before.py
# FromVersion: v1.0
# ToVersion: v1.1
# InputFile: before.py
# OutputFile: before_1.1.py
# ArtifactID: <generated-uuid>

[Section]
Anchor: constants
AnchorType: artificial
Action: replace
Content:
    # ARTIFICIAL ANCHOR: constants
    VERSION = "v1.1"

[Section]
Anchor: def process_data(input_data):
AnchorType: natural
Action: replace
Content:
    def process_data(input_data):
        import re
        fields = re.split(r'\|', input_data)
        return fields
!DONE!


Apply the Generated Patch: Use grokpatcher.py to apply the generated patch, as described in grokpatcher.md or the examples/README.md. For example:
pbcopy < examples/generated_patch.grokpatch
python src/grokpatcher.py

Then paste the patch content (Command + V on macOS) into the running grokpatcher.py.


Installation

Save src/patchBuilder.py (implementation).
Save docs/patchBuilder.md (this documentation).

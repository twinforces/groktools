GrokPatcher: A Python Script Patching System
GrokPatcher is a lightweight, continuous patching system for applying updates to Python scripts, designed to handle large files and avoid resource limits. It uses natural and artificial anchors to target code sections, with !GO! and !DONE! delimiters for seamless patch input. Part of the groktools suite, it integrates with Versioning, Changelogs, Prompt Storage, and Restart tools for robust script maintenance.
Features

Continuous Operation: Runs as a service, accepting patches via stdin until !DONE! terminates it.
Patch Delimiters: Non-final patches end with !GO!; the final patch ends with !DONE!, logging "Patches complete" and exiting.
Logging: Logs "Applying patch:  -> " for each patch.
Natural and Artificial Anchors:
Natural: Python constructs like def, if, for, while, identified by regex (e.g., ^def\s+\w+\s*\(.*\):). Must be unique within the script.
Artificial: Comments (e.g., # ARTIFICIAL ANCHOR: prompt) for non-natural boundaries. Must be unique within the script.


Incremental Versioning: Supports sequences like 1.0 -> 1.1, integrable with the Versioning toolâ€™s VERSION constant.
Markdown Compatibility: Escapes backticks () as ` in patches, de-escaped during application.
Self-Contained Patches: Specify input/output files and actions (replace, insert, delete).

Patch Format
A GrokPatcher patch is a text input ending with !GO! or !DONE!:
# GrokPatcher v1.0
# Target: example_script.py
# FromVersion: 1.0
# ToVersion: 1.1
# InputFile: example_script.py
# OutputFile: example_script_1.1.py
# ArtifactID: <UUID>

[Section]
Anchor: function_process_data
AnchorType: natural
Action: replace
Content:
    def process_data(input_data):
        # Content with backticks escaped as \`
!GO!


Header Fields:
Target: Script file to patch.
FromVersion, ToVersion: Version transition.
InputFile, OutputFile: File paths.
ArtifactID: Unique identifier.


Section Fields:
Anchor: Unique identifier for the code section.
AnchorType: natural or artificial.
Action: replace, insert, or delete.
Content: New code, indented with 4 spaces, backticks escaped.


Delimiters:
!GO!: Ends non-final patches.
!DONE!: Ends the final patch, logging "Patches complete", renaming the output, and terminating.

[Insert content from grokpatcher_prompt.md here, identical to above]

Installation

Save grokpatcher.py (implementation).
Save GROKPATCHER.md (this documentation).
Ensure https://github.com/twinforces/groktools/docs/grokpatcher_prompt.md is accessible.
Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.
No external dependencies required.

Usage
Run GrokPatcher as a continuous service:
python grokpatcher.py


Paste patches, each ending with !GO! or !DONE! for the final patch.
Example (macOS):pbpaste < patch_file.grokpatch


Continue pasting until !DONE! is received, which logs "Patches complete" and exits.

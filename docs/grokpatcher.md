grokpatcher (Version 1.0)
GrokPatcher is a lightweight, continuous patching system for applying updates to Python scripts, designed to handle large files and avoid resource limits. It uses natural and artificial anchors to target code sections, with !GO!, !NEXT!, and !DONE! delimiters for seamless patch input. Part of the groktools suite, it integrates with Versioning, Changelogs, Prompt Storage, and Restart tools for robust script maintenance. Tell Grok to read prompts/grokpatcher_prompt.md to use this feature, or https://github.com/twinforces/groktools/docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md to use all features.

Why: Grok has limits on responses which causes large scripts to be truncated. It tries to ameliorate this by producing partial diffs, but it can be tedious to track "...rest remains the same..." when its buried in a script. Hence, automation! `patch` would be better, but grok can't produce a proper diff -u result for more than one change at a time. 

Features

Continuous Operation: Runs as a service, accepting patches via stdin until !DONE! terminates it.
Patch Delimiters:
!GO!: Completes a patch section for the current file.
!NEXT!: Writes the current output file and starts a new patch for another file.
!DONE!: Completes the final patch, renaming the output, and exits.


Logging: Logs "Applying patch:  -> " for each patch.
Natural and Artificial Anchors:
Natural: Python constructs like def, if, for, while, identified by regex (e.g., ^def\s+\w+\s*\(.*\):). Must be unique within the script.
Artificial: Comments (e.g., # ARTIFICIAL ANCHOR: prompt) for non-natural boundaries. Must be unique within the script.


Incremental Versioning: Supports sequences like 1.0 -> 1.1, integrable with the Versioning toolâ€™s VERSION constant.
Markdown Compatibility: Escapes backticks () as ` in patches, de-escaped during application.
Self-Contained Patches: Specify input/output files and actions (replace, insert, delete).

Patch Format
A GrokPatcher patch is a text input ending with !GO!, !NEXT!, or !DONE!:
# GrokPatcher v1.0
# Target: example_script.py
# FromVersion: 1.0
# ToVersion: 1.1
# InputFile: example_script.py
# OutputFile: example_script_1.1.py
# ArtifactID: <UUID>

[Section]
Anchor: function_process_data
AnchorType: natural
Action: replace
Content:
    def process_data(input_data):
        # Content with backticks escaped as \`
!GO!

[Section]
Anchor: constants
AnchorType: artificial
Action: insert
Content:
    # ARTIFICIAL ANCHOR: constants
    VERSION = "v1.1"
!NEXT!

# GrokPatcher v1.0
# Target: another_script.py
# FromVersion: 2.0
# ToVersion: 2.1
# InputFile: another_script.py
# OutputFile: another_script_2.1.py
# ArtifactID: <UUID>

[Section]
Anchor: main
AnchorType: natural
Action: replace
Content:
    def main():
        # Updated main logic
!DONE!


Header Fields:
Target: Script file to patch.
FromVersion, ToVersion: Version transition.
InputFile, OutputFile: File paths.
ArtifactID: Unique identifier.


Section Fields:
Anchor: Unique identifier for the code section.
AnchorType: natural or artificial.
Action: replace, insert, or delete.
Content: New code, indented with 4 spaces, backticks escaped.


Delimiters:
!GO!: Ends a patch section for the current file.
!NEXT!: Writes the output file and starts a new patch.
!DONE!: Writes, renames, and terminates.



Patch Generation Instructions
The following instructions, hosted at https://github.com/twinforces/groktools/docs/prompts/grokpatcher_prompt.md, guide patch generation:

[Insert content from grokpatcher_prompt.md here, identical to above]

Installation

Save src/grokpatcher.py (implementation).
Save docs/grokpatcher.md (this documentation).
Ensure https://github.com/twinforces/groktools/docs/prompts/grokpatcher_prompt.md is accessible.
Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.
No external dependencies required.

Usage
Run GrokPatcher as a continuous service:
python src/grokpatcher.py 
when you have a set of patches to apply.


Paste patches, ending with !GO!, !NEXT!, or !DONE! to grokpatcher window.
Example (macOS):pbpaste < examples/patch_example_1.0_to_1.1.grokpatch or click the copy icon in the display box in grok, then paste in the terminal. 


Continue until !DONE! logs "Patches complete" and exits.

Limitations

This doesn't do any kind of checksum or SHA on the result, because when experimenting, grok seemed unable to compute one reliably.

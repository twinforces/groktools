versioning (Version 1.0)
Versioning is a groktools component that ensures Python scripts maintain a VERSION constant to track their version. It integrates with Changelogs, Prompt Storage, and Restart tools for comprehensive script maintenance. Tell Grok to read prompts/versioning_prompt.md to use this feature, or https://github.com/twinforces/groktools/docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md to use all features.
Features

VERSION Constant: A constant (e.g., VERSION = "v1.1") tracks the scriptâ€™s version.
Incremental Updates: Updates the VERSION constant to match the target version.
Consistency: Ensures version alignment across updates.

Versioning Requirements

VERSION Constant: Include a VERSION constant in the script, typically in a constants section (e.g., # ARTIFICIAL ANCHOR: constants).
Version Updates: Update the VERSION constant in each change to match the target version.
Placement: If no constants section exists, insert one with an artificial anchor.

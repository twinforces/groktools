Changelogs: A GrokTools Change Tracking System
Changelogs is a groktools component that ensures Python scripts maintain a Change Log section to record version changes, artifact IDs, and prompts, providing traceability for script evolution. It integrates with GrokPatcher, Versioning, Prompt Storage, and Restart tools.
Features

Change Log Section: A section (e.g., # ARTIFICIAL ANCHOR: changelog) records version history.
Content: Includes version number, change description, artifact ID, and prompt for each update.
Incremental Updates: Appends new entries with each patch, preserving history.
Integration: Works with GrokPatcherâ€™s anchor-based patching system.

Changelogs Requirements

Change Log Section: Include a Change Log section in the script, typically as a docstring or comment block.
Content: Record version number, change description, artifact ID, and prompt (or prompt URL).
Updates: Append new entries with each patch.
Placement: If no changelog section exists, insert one with an artificial anchor.

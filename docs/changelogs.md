changelogs (Version 1.0)
Changelogs is a groktools component that ensures Python scripts maintain a Change Log section to record version changes, artifact IDs, and prompts, providing traceability for script evolution. It integrates with Versioning, Prompt Storage, and Restart tools. Tell Grok to read prompts/changelogs_prompt.md to use this feature, or https://github.com/twinforces/groktools/docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md to use all features.
Features

Change Log Section: A section (e.g., # ARTIFICIAL ANCHOR: changelog) records version history.
Content: Includes version number, change description, artifact ID, and prompt for each update.
Incremental Updates: Appends new entries with each change, preserving history.

Changelogs Requirements

Change Log Section: Include a Change Log section in the script, typically as a docstring or comment block.
Content: Record version number, change description, artifact ID, and prompt (or prompt URL).

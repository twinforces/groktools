Changelogs
Changelogs is a mechanism in groktools for maintaining a Change Log section in Python scripts to record updates and artifact IDs. It ensures a clear history of script modifications, independent of versioning or patching processes.
Overview

Purpose: Document script updates, including changes and artifact IDs, for traceability.
Mechanism: Uses a Change Log section in scripts, updated by Grok during script modifications.
Usage: Managed by Grok via specific prompts for changelog updates.

Usage

Add Change Log Section:

Include a Change Log section in scripts to record updates.
Example:# Change Log:
# - Initial version, artifact ID: 1234
# - Added feature, artifact ID: 5678
VERSION = "1.1"




Update Change Log:

Grok updates the Change Log section with new entries during script modifications, using docs/prompts/changelogs_prompt.md or docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md.


Track Artifacts:

Include artifact IDs to link updates to specific Grok-generated outputs.



Workflow

Change Logging: Tell Grok to manage changelog updates by referencing docs/prompts/changelogs_prompt.md or docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md.
Script Updates: Grok adds new entries to the Change Log during script modifications, independent of versioning or patching.

Notes

Changelogs are orthogonal to versioning, grok: annotations, patch generation, and patch application, focusing solely on maintaining the Change Log section.
The patching system (e.g., grokpatcher.py, patchBuilder.py, diffextract.py) facilitates changelog updates by automating script modifications, making it easier to track changes.
Change Log updates are managed by Grok, not user-side tools, typically via docs/prompts/changelogs_prompt.md or docs/prompts/groktools_meta_prompt.md, which are Grok-side tool prompts in the Grok programming language.
For versioning details, see docs/versioning.md.
For patching, see docs/grokpatcher.md and docs/patchBuilder.md.

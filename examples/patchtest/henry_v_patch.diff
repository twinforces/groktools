 Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
 Or, like to men proud of destruction,
 Defy us to our worst. For, as I am a soldier,
 A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
 If I begin the batt’ry once again,
 I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
 Till in her ashes she lie burièd.
 The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
 And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,
 In liberty of bloody hand, shall range
 With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
 Your fresh fair virgins and your flow’ring infants.

 Enlinked to waste and desolation?
